      <li class="ingredients">8 slices of Munster cheese (you can use your favorite cheese slices if you like)</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li class="steps">Preheat your oven to 450 degrees</li>
      <li class="steps">Place about 10 to 12 medium-sized jalapeno peppers on a baking sheet that has been lined with parchment paper</li>
      <li class="steps">Roast the peppers until the skins have blackened, and the peppers have turned from a bright shiny green to a dull green collar</li>
      <li class="steps">Cooking the peppers will take about 10 - 12 minutes</li>
      <li class="steps">With gloved hands, pull off the skin of the peppers</li>
      <li class="steps">Pull the stem off of the peppers, and then open the peppers up with one cut down the pepper, open the pepper and then scrape out the seeds</li>
      <li class="steps">If you like a lot of heat leave the peppers whole, if not, consider cutting them into small strips</li>
      <li class="steps">Turn the oven down to 400 degrees, you will cook the sandwiches in there</li>
      <li class="steps">In a small bowl combine cream cheese, Hellmann’s® Mayonnaise, shredded cheddar cheese, ground chipotle (optional), and Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li class="steps">Stir until the cheese filling is uniform</li>
      <li class="steps">Prepare the sandwiches by spreading 1/4 of the cheese mixture on 4 slices of bread</li>
      <li class="steps">Place jalapeno pepper pieces on top of the cheese, you will want to cover up the cheese filling</li>
      <li class="steps">Place 6 pieces of bacon on the peppers (that's 3 pieces of whole bacon that you broke in half), and then top with 2 slices of cheese</li>
      <li class="steps">Top sandwich with the remaining slice of bread</li>
      <li class="steps">Lightly butter the outer pieces of bread on each sandwich</li>
      <li class="steps">Place sandwiches on a baking sheet</li>
      <li class="steps">Bake sandwiches for about 5 minutes or until golden brown, flip sandwiches over, and continue to bake until they are golden brown</li>
      <li class="steps">They will take less time on the outside. If you have a convection oven, be extra careful with the time</li>
    </ol>
